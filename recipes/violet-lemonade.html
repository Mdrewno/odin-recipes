    <h3>Springtime Violet Lemonade</h3>

    <p>On a sunny spring day it is a great opportunity to get outside and find a field of violets to forage for fresh lemonade. Adding violets to lemonade brings in a slight floral flavor and a beautiful light purple tint. Poured over ice, this drink makes a perfect springtime refreshment.</p>
